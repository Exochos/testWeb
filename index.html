							<h3>Monitoring and refinement of business processes and real time personalization</h3>

AI will increasingly be monitoring and refining business processes
Artificial Intelligence is rapidly changing the way business processes are performed today. This increased level of automation streamlines day-to-day processes and in turn, increases business profitability. The automation of administrative tasks in the workplace looks like improving team meetings by using voice assistants to schedule and record meetings. Voice assistant technology is also capable of capturing key highlights and actions. In addition, this technology can create and share actionable notes following the meeting. Another key feature of voice assistant technology is the customer service-centric ability to capture client calls, transcribe the entire conversation, and automatically summarize key items and actions.
Similar to the voice assistant is the digital assistance; often seen as chatbots, self-service troubleshooting mods where customers can interact and get troubleshooting solutions to resolve their concerns. AI also has the capability of analyzing call center calls for quality of service given and can detect inappropriate and problematic customer service with more than twice the accuracy of a voice recognition system. In HR, AI can create online platforms capable of conducting initial interviews of candidates in their own homes. According to Unilever, around 70,000 person-hours of interviewing and assessing candidates have been cut thanks to the automated screening of candidates.
The personalization of AI is highly acclaimed for the success of giants like Amazon, Alibaba, and Google. The power of AI has given these companies the ability to deliver personalized experiences and recommendations. AI allows providers of goods and services to quickly and accurately project a 360-degree view of products in real-time as they interact through online portals and mobile apps, quickly learning how their predictions can fit our wants and needs.

							<h3>Increased Accuracy and Availability of Data will Improve AI Usefulness And Result In An Increase of Devices That Will Run AI-powered Technology</h3>
							<article>
The quality of information available is often a barrier to businesses and organizations wanting to move towards AI-driven automated decision-making. But as technology and methods of simulating real-world processes and mechanisms in the digital domain have improved over recent years, accurate data has become increasingly available. Simulations have advanced to the stage where car manufacturers and others working on the development of autonomous vehicles can gain thousands of hours of driving data without vehicles even leaving the lab, leading to huge reductions in cost as well as increases in the quality of data that can be gathered. This decade will see an increase in the accuracy and availability of real-world simulations, which in turn will lead to more powerful and accurate AI.
As the hardware and expertise needed to deploy AI become cheaper and more available, we will start to see it used in an increasing number of tools, gadgets, and devices. In 2020, weâ€™re already used to running apps that give us AI-powered predictions on our computers, phones, and watches. Have you noticed Amazon's recommendations for you when you shop on their website or app? How about Netflix's recommendations of shows that you might like to binge watch?
In this new decade, the cost of hardware and software will continue to fall and AI tools will increasingly be embedded into our vehicles, household appliances, and workplace tools. You can see it in home security systems by Ring, Nest, and Arlo. AI has been implanted in Tesla's Autopilot System in their automobiles while other auto manufacturers also have some form of it in their own products. Artificial Intelligence will be augmented by technology such as virtual and augmented reality displays, and coalescing with paradigms like the cloud and Internet of Things, this decade will see more and more devices of every shape and size starting to think and learn for themselves.
